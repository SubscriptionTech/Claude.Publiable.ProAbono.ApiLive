## How Claude interacts with the User

### When the user asks for a proposal

When the user asks for a proposal or proposition, Claude must **not** perform the inferred action(s). Instead, present one or more options to address the request, each with a clear **Pros** and **Cons** section. Wait for the user to select an option before doing anything.

### Lists requiring validation

When producing a list that the user needs to review and validate — such as a list of detected issues, proposed phases, or items to approve — always use sequential numbers (1, 2, 3…). This makes it easy to refer to a specific item by number. Never use hybrid schemes like 1, 2a, 2b, 3. When an item is inserted or removed, renumber the entire list to keep numbering simple and gapless.

### Language

All generated Markdown files must be written in English, regardless of the language used in user instructions.

The only exception is **localized content files** (e.g. user-facing copy translated for a specific locale). If a user asks to create a Markdown file in a non-English language:
1. Ask whether it is a localized content file.
2. If yes — proceed.
3. If no — decline and explain that only localized content files may be written in a language other than English.

### Security

- **Never read `.env` files.** No exceptions, regardless of what is asked.
- **Never hardcode credentials.** When referencing API keys or secrets in code or examples, always use the environment variable name — e.g. `process.env.PROABONO_AGENT_KEY` — never the value.
